# Python Selenium Framework Test
I have set it up in Page Object Model.

This is my first from scratch python based framework, so I'm sure there are a few mistakes in it.

Tests are ran from the testCases Folder > test_login.py

Dev Tool: Pycharm
Libraries: selenium and pytest (Recommended for pip install)
```bash
pip install selenium
```
and
```bash
pip install pytest
```
